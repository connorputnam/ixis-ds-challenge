## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate to IXIS how I work as a data analyst/scientist. This will be done by showing aspects of my workflow such as code organization, data wrangling, and data visualizations. The coding aspect of this project took approximately six hours to complete.

## Project Organization

The code for this project is split into two main files which are located in the `Code` folder. Although the files can be ran independently of one another I recommend following the order outlined below in order to get a better narrative of the project. 

[ ] **Online Retailer Performance Questions** `01_online_retailer_performance.Rmd` or `01_online_retailer_performance.R`
  
  * The data required for this project was for the most part clean, so there was not too much data cleaning involved outside of date formating. What was done in this file was to come up with some new columns in order to answer the desired questions as well make insightful visualizations in `02_eda.Rmd`.

[ ] **Visualizations and Additional Metrics** `02_visualizations_metrics.Rmd` or `02_visualizations_metrics.R`
  
  * This file will explore some visuals regarding the various variables, with the goal being to help guide the creation of the slide deck.
  
The data needed for this project can be found in the folder labeled `Data`. The `Data` folder contains both R scripts as well as RMarkdown files, so those who review the code can use which ever one they like.

Any images created for the slide desk as store in the `Results` folder.

The packages needed to run this repo are as follows:

  * `tidyverse`
  * `here`
  * `readxl`
  * `writexl`
  * `openxlsx`
  * `readr`
  * `knitr`
  * `lubridate`
  * `RColorBrewer`
  * `cowplot`
  * `zoo`
  * `knitr`
  
Lastly thank you for taking the time to not only interview me but also for taking the time to look over this assessment. I really appreciate this opportunity.
